# BootFX
BootFX is a battle-tested ORM for .NET. It was originally started in 2001, whilst .NET was in beta development 
and testing. (Think back to Wrox Press red cover books, such as Professional C# and Beginning ASP.NET.) As such, 
you will find some old-school concepts in there. :) This v6 release focuses on the core
data access and ORM classes, together with the sort of helper claseses and utilities that come out of 18 years of 
continuous use in enterprise environments. It's now a .NET Standard 2.0 project, MIT licensed, and the first version to be publicly available.
